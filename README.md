Have you ever just wanted a simple bouncing rectangle as your macOS screensaver?  How about one that you can change the size, color, *and* speed of!?

Well want no more!! :-D

## Installation
1. Download and unzip [Blok.saver.zip](https://github.com/jguice/blok/blob/master/Blok.saver.zip)

2. Double-click it

That's it!  You can configure it just like any other screensaver.

Want to know why they call it a "screensaver"?  Check out [the history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screensaver) (**spoiler alert**: they're mostly pointless these days, except for burning unused CPU time, and keeping fans moving).

## Pro Tips
1. I like to set a "Hot Corner" to kick off the screensaver.  Then when I'm walking away from my mac I just drag the mouse quickly to a corner and it starts right away.

2. If you also set a password to be required 5 seconds after screensaver initiation, this will keep folks from inverting your colors, changing your keyboard to dvorak, etc. while you are away (and make security people happy if you work in a company environment). ;)

   5 seconds is a nice compromise, because it covers the case where you accidentally find the hot corner with your cursor, but isn't really enough time for someone to get onto your computer without you still being close enough to notice.
